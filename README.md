## Workflow

Create a branch to work in. When done create a pull request to main. Only closed pull requests will publish a new package version.
If you delete the branch to early after merge, it will not get published. Wait for the publish commit! The merge seems to only choose one commit to be in the publish commit. That will effect how the new version will be. breaking, minor, or patch.
